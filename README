moderncv -- a modern curriculum vitae class

Moderncv provides a documentclass for typesetting modern curriculum vitaes, both in a
classic and in a casual style. It is fairly customisable, allowing you to define your own
style by changing the colors, the fonts, ...

The moderncv documentclass need it's input to be formatted with regular commands
(\section, \subsection, \maketitle, ...), but also defines its own special commands
(\cventry, \makequote, \firsname, \familyname, ...).
All the commands are defined in such a way that the arguments are always optional.

Documents can be compiled into dvi, ps or pdf.

Until a decent manual is written, you can always look in the "examples" directory for
some decent examples.
